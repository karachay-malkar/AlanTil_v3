# Guide and Learn checkpoint

Reference: Web 13.15.12 / 3249e0d3364656e1030d50791b24aaa8789ed1b8.
Input mobile: 4a91cd4a327c58cc915ab5f3b22fcec26431b33d.

## Changes
- Guide uses a same-window overlay and subtracts its measured origin from native target coordinates. No guessed status-bar adjustment.
- Minimum spotlight dimensions expand around the button center.
- Panel placement uses original Web candidate ordering, overlap penalties and card anchor, avoiding Undo/Favorite for all Learn phases.
- Closing/skipping immediately unmounts the guide, before persisting its completed flag.
- Learn header/system Back requests confirmation for an unfinished session. Stay preserves state; confirmation saves the snapshot before navigating. Uses the original localized message and Alan exit phrase.
- Card shadow moved off the two rotating faces onto their common rounded container. Inactive faces also explicitly fade out at the half-turn to prevent Android backface compositing artifacts.
- CI render script now walks all five Learn guide steps, checks the favorite spotlight center, guide removal and cancel/confirm exit.

## Evidence and limits
193 executable/source tests and eight source gates passed locally before commit. Actual build/render results must be checked for this commit; no Android device is attached. Gray-frame removal and hardware Back still need native acceptance, not just a browser image. Full Q03 remains open.

## Remaining work
| Area | Remaining acceptance |
|---|---|
| All screens | Paired visual comparison with exact Web reference, same data, locale, size |
| Guide | Native alignment at different safe-area sizes; all Path/Station help steps |
| Learn | Native flip/swipe/undo and frame cleanup; exact surface/colors |
| Test/Match | UI-level 20/40/80, directions, interrupted restoration, results |
| Account | Real Google callback, cold start, cancel, logout, restart |
| Progress | Offline, guest transfer, conflict/sync and no data loss |
| Content | Filled favorites, songs/audio, authenticated profile/statistics |
| Languages | RU/EN/TR, script/dialect and long-text S/M/L |

## Session exit and storage follow-up — 2026-09-09

- All four session modes now share the same confirmation flow and localized exit phrase. Failed final persistence leaves the screen open for retry.
- Session storage captures the user scope and namespace at invocation, serializes the snapshot immediately, and orders read/write/clear operations per key. Regression tests cover account switching during migration, pending writes followed by completion clear, and restore waiting for save.
- Station statistics and Profile tabs/metrics/settings links use the original semantic font sizes.
- Local selected suite: 199 tests pass; all eight existing source gates pass.
- Expanded CI scenarios: Test 20/40/80 in both directions, answering then exit/restore; Match 20/40/80 count and restore; cancel/confirm for both games; Stage Test cancel. These are acceptance requests until the new CI run succeeds, not completed results.
- Scope still open: exact paired visual reference comparison for all states; Android hardware Back, gray-frame acceptance and gestures; live OAuth/device lifecycle, cloud/offline sync, populated songs/favorites and authenticated UI.

## Learn surface and Stele typography — 2026-09-09

- Replaced flat Learn face fill with the exact 145-degree Web gradient, including both RGBA stops. SVG endpoints preserve the CSS angle for each measured card aspect ratio.
- Responsive front/back padding now follows learn.css, including the <=420px override.
- Translation weight/line-height and example/ordinal line-height now follow the final original CSS rules.
- Stele title/body use semantic S/M/L sizes. Overflow fitting may tighten line spacing and gaps but cannot shrink the font below the selected semantic size; scrolling remains available.
- 202 local tests and eight source gates passed. CI now checks exact default Stele body size rather than only a minimum.
- Remaining acceptance is unchanged: paired original Web visuals, native device rendering/lifecycle, real OAuth, cloud sync and filled-state coverage remain open.
